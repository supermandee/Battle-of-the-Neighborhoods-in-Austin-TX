# Battle-of-the-Neighborhoods-in-Austin-TX
This project aims to utilize data science concepts and machine learning tools learned in the Coursera IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Course to solve a popular problem for restaurant owners: where is the best neighborhood to open a restaurant? In this project, I will go through the processes of problem definition, data preparation, and use machine learning to improve business decisions.
Included in the Repository are the Jupyter Notebook, Neighborhood data I found on austintexas.gov, maps I created. Check out the notebook for more!
